# d3.js Bar Chart

#### Description: Bar chart created with d3.js. Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I created a bar chart using d3.js that displays the United States GDP from 1947 to 2015. The year is on the x axis and the total GDP is on the y axis. I designed it so that when a bar is hovered over, it turns yellow. I chose yellow since it is the opposite of blue and would stand out more.
